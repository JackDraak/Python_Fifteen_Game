# Work In Progress (WIP)

This directory contains experimental AI implementations and historical code from the development process.

## Contents

- **AI_Gemini_2_5_pro_DQN.py** - Deep Q-Network implementation using Gemini AI assistance
- **AI_GPT5_Q.py** - Q-learning implementation developed with GPT assistance
- **AI_MCTS_controller.py** - Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation
- **AI_Neural_MCTS_controller.py** - Neural network enhanced MCTS approach
- **AI_QtMCTS_controller.py** - Qt-based MCTS implementation
- **AI_random_controller.py** - Random move baseline controller
- **teach_GPT_Q.py** - Educational Q-learning example

## Purpose

These files represent:
- **Historical Development**: Earlier iterations and experimental approaches
- **Algorithm Exploration**: Various AI techniques tested during development
- **Reference Material**: Examples of different implementation strategies
- **Learning Artifacts**: Code generated during AI-assisted development sessions

## Status

⚠️ **Not Production Ready**: These implementations may be incomplete, experimental, or superseded by the main project code in `/fifteen/`.

For current, stable AI implementations, see:
- `/fifteen/AI_controller.py` (Reinforcement Learning)
- `/fifteen/OptimalAI.py` (Optimal Search)
