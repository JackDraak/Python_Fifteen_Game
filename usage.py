    Project Name:   'fifteen'
    Project Scope:  The 'fifteen' project is a Python 3 model of the classic 2D tile game known as
    the "15 puzzle". The model and view are contained within the Game class, 'Game.py', which is
    controlled via your preferred controller, i.e. 'GUI_controller.py', 'console_controller.py', or
    'GUI_controller.py' or AI_trainer_controller.py for RMLA. Additionally, the Game class relies 
    upon 'Tile.py', the Tile class, used as a struct to contain the game-state of the individual 
    tiles of the game matrix.""")
