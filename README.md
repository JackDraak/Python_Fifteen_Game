# Python: Fifteen Puzzle Game
_The classic 2-dimensional tile-game "Fifteen", modeled in Python 3_

Thank you for your interest in my project. I've been using this repository as a vehicle to get some experience with the Python syntax. Fundamentally, this means it's in flux. It began as a console game, so that I could hit the ground running (i.e. get some solid results, rapidly, without the need to dive into multiple layers of new framework). If you start to dig through the history, your sanity is in your hands -- I take no responsibility. 

At this point, the _console version_ is fairly polished, and offers not only the game "15", but also any matrix dimension from 3-31 (and now, as a bonus, it offers a (q)uit option at every prompt, as well as dual-play modes: WASD or numerical.)

The code is not perfect, but I was also itching to get a _GUI mode_ going, and so now if you run from __GUI_controller.py__ a crude PyGame interface allows the game to be played with a pointer device.
