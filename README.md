# Fifteen Puzzle AI Educational Project

An educational implementation of the classic fifteen puzzle with reinforcement learning and optimal search AI approaches.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JackDraak/Python_Fifteen_Game.git
cd Python_Fifteen_Game/fifteen
pip install numpy  # Required
python integrated_demo.py  # Start educational demo
```

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates two distinct AI approaches for solving the fifteen puzzle:
- **Reinforcement Learning AI**: Learns through trial and error using Deep Q-Networks
- **Optimal Search AI**: Uses IDA* algorithm with mathematical guarantees

## Documentation

ðŸ“š **Complete documentation and usage guides are in `/fifteen/README.md`**

The main implementation and all educational materials are located in the `/fifteen` directory.

## Project Structure

- `/fifteen/` - Main project with comprehensive documentation
- `setup.py` - Package configuration for legacy compatibility
- `requirements.txt` - Basic dependencies
- `WIP/` - Work-in-progress experimental AI implementations
